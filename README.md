# Sales-Performance-of-Video-Games-
Developed a comprehensive analysis of video game sales using supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The project involved building regression models to predict global sales based on numerical and categorical features and comparing their accuracy. Explored single and multiple feature models, including linear and non-linear approaches, and evaluated the impact of feature selection on model performance.

Additionally, trained an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for prediction and compared its performance with other models. Used k-Means clustering to identify patterns in sales data and compared it with other clustering algorithms to determine the best clustering strategy.
